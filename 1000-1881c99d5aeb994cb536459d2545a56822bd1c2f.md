#Try something new.

## Hello world!

For the longest time I wanted to pick up blogging again. I one wrote
fairly often, sometimes abandoning projects, often switching my pseudonym.

I actually blogged before once upon a time but the trolls and those few
web stalkers who try to find where you live kind-of get to you after
a while and you decided you don't want to be part of that any more.

So I decided to try something new. We're at an interesting time where
out-of-the-blue being a nameless faceless person on the internet is 
nearly unheard of. Instead of sticking with some code-name I wanted
to get as far away from a name as possible, and not being bound to any
one given medium or website to host postings, yet also keeping the 
ability to say that a post is genuinely my own.

What I came up with was a "SHA1-Chain" which isn't that unique or special,
and someone might actually be doing this somewhere. I think Twitter's new
2-factor auth system uses a technique that has some common concept with what 
I'm doing but I never looked at that very deeply.

## What am I doing?

I grab a specific number of bytes from a random-like source (in my case, 
/dev/urandom). I then compute the SHA1 of that seed, and then the SHA1 of 
that value, and so on and so on about 1000 times, thus leading to a series of
pointers from the first SHA1 value easily determining the next, down to the last.
SHA1 being a one-way hashing function, this makes it highly unlikely but not
entirely impossible  that someone can discover my origin seed of the series.

Now I just need to keep my seed secure, like I do with my private keys, and 
I've granted myself the ability to keep an online identity (which I could have
assigned a name to if I wanted, and it doesn't even need to be one of mine)
without keeping some account on some website with some password.

I'm not suggesting this is a replacement for logging in, just an idea I'm 
running with that tackles the specific issue I was working with. If you'd like
to know how, I've made the PHP script available in a git repo where I started
this. The first commit of the repo would be all you need to fork off of to start
doing what I'm doing with your own key.

If you start to 'run out' of posts and want to blog more then you have, you could 
also fork from some point, create a new seed, announce the SHA(n+1) value in a present
post, and release SHA(n) when ready. It's a bit weird, but this whole thing is weird too.

I realize there are many other attacks on the integrity that can happen, such 
as after-the-fact having the publisher change the message text, or possibly an
attacker who beats you to the audience every time. There are ways to combat those
things too, but for now this is good enough for me.

## Thanks

Hopefully you'll enjoy my series of posts.
